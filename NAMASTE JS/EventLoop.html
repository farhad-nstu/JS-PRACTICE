<h1>EVENT LOOP</h1>

<u>
    <li>setTimeout</li>
    <li>Fetch()</li>
    <li>Console</li>
    <li>DOM APIs (document.getElemenById, document.on(click) etc.)</li>
    <li>Localstorage</li>
    <li>Location (https://)</li>

    <p>These all are not a part of JS thats are part of Browser.</p>

    <p>when we call a addEventListener btn all callback function store inside Web APIs. After finish all task in Global Execution Context 
        then these call back push into calback queue. and then via event look it moves to call stack.
    </p>

    <p>Event lool always notice that is call stack is empty (Global Execution finished) and is there anythings in call back queue.
        if found somethings in call back queue then push it into call stack.</p>

    <p>Here another queue (micro tasks queue) which are more priority come first then call back queue. 
        Such that are promises and mutation observers. Event look first notice the microtask queue. then call back queue.</p>

    <p>As micro task queue is the first priority then call back queue os if there many many micro task queue then what happen 
        in call back queue. this situation is called STARVATION</p>

    callback function -> callback queue -> event loop -> call stack -> execution
