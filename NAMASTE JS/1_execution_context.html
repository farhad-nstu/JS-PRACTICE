<h1>EXECUTION CONTEXT</h1>
<p>JS is a Synchronous Single Threaded language.</p>
<p>Everything in JS happens inside an execution context.</p>
<p>It's like as a big box whose have two components.
    <u>
        <li><b>Memory execution / Variable environment:</b> all variables and function stored here. Variable store here in key:value format.</li>
        <li><b>Code/Thread of execution:</b> here all code are executed. Execute one line at a time in a Synchronous way that means first thing first done then go to the next line. So JS is called Synchronous Single Threaded language.</li>
