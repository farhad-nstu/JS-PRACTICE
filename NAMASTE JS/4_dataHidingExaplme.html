<h1>Data hiding (encaptulation) using closure</h1>
<script>
    // anyone can access this increment function and can change the count value.
    var count = 0;

    function increment() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
    }
    increment();
    increment();
    increment();

    // To overcome this we can use closure to hide data which known as encaptulation. in below given an example.
    function incrementCounter() {
        var count = 0;

        return function increment() {
            count++;
            console.log(count);
        }
    }
    var counter1 = incrementCounter();
    counter1();
    counter1();
    counter1();
    counter1();
    counter1();
    // incrementCounter()(); // we can call a closure like this also

    // when we create again a new var with incrementCounter then we get again from starting
    var counter2 = incrementCounter();
    counter2();
    counter2();

    // what if there come a situation to find the decrement also. that time this procedure will not work.
    // reason is this not a scalable process. to find increment and decrement together we can use constructor function.
    // constructor will describe in another file.
